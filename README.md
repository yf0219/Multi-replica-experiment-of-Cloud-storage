# Multi-replica-experiment-of-Cloud-storage
Experiments on the Cloud storage multi replica integrity scheme of the Internet of Things
We ran a series of experiments on the 2.80 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16.0GB RAM
 All the experiments use the Type A with the free Pairing- Based Cryptography (PBC) Library. In the implementation, we choose the based filed size to be 512 bits, and the size of Zp to be 160 bits, this is, |p| = 160 bits
 The. txt files in the folder are all generated by the system
 SystemInitialization is the JAVA file that runs when the system is established
 PrivateKeyGeneration is the JAVA file that runs the key generation
 ReplicaFilesGeneration is the JAVA file that runs for multi copy generation
 TagsSetGeneration is the JAVA file that the tag generation runs on
 The meanings represented by other files are also shown in the file names. Our experimental focus is on generating multiple copies of files, label generation files, and evidence generation, aggregation, and validation files
